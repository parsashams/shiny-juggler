Shiny Juggler
=============

This is a simple app written in [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) with the intention of
managing a diversified data science team using [Trello](http://www.trello.com). While Trello 
is a wonderful Kanban tool, it does not have the full set of features necessariy for agile. 
This tool tries to bridge that gap. 

This tool is written by Parsa Shams, and is distributed under the MIT license.
